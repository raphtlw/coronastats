A small app project which shows the statistics of the Corona Virus.

I created this app because I couldn't find any good Corona Virus tracking apps for mobile devices, some were either filled with ads or the design was too messy.

## Link to app

To use the app, just go to [coronastats.now.sh](https://coronastats.now.sh)
